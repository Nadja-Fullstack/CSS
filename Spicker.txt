Styles: internal, inline, external


Selectors:

Internal styles: 
1. ag alement: 
- used to select all elements of specific types on the page;
- CSS: e.g. p { for the paragraph}, where p is the name of the tag, the element in the {} will be used for all p on the page;

2. id:
- used to select particular element/tag on the page according to its id;
- CSS: e.g. #identificator (i.e. my-id) {... -> rule / specifications / features}; e.g. <div id="my-id">This could be your text</div>. Styles will be used only for that element with the id selector;

3. class selector: 
 - for group of elements with the same class; 
 - CSS: starting with . + name of class (e.g. my-class) {..-> rule} -> .my-class; example: <p class="my-class">Text</p> - will be used for all elements with the same class

 Note: to use to different classes: class < class1 class2> -> in the <> to use 2 or more classes withouth any comma only backspace 

 Cascading: if two identical features with the same specificity conflict, that those will apply which stands below on the page (i.e. last in the style range)

 Specificity: the selector with the highest specificity will apply -> tag selector has specificity of 001, class selector has specificity of 010, id selector has specificity of 100. Inline-stlyes has the highest specificity 1000.

 Inline styles: 
 Incorporate directly for the element with "class" followed directly by specifications/features; used mostly in JS, using in CCS worst praxises 

 External styles: to be added in "head" from the external style.css file; linking by the command "link rel..."
